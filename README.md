Hello, I am Scarlet. I am an experienced developer specialized in .NET technologies with relevance on web backend and mobile/desktop/web frontend. Between the stacks that I already have worked on, I can highlight ASP.NET, MAUI (mobile and desktop development), WPF, Windows Forms. In the past I have also worked with Unity, MonoDevelop and other old .NET technologies such as .NET Framework applications and a sort of old libraries like Crystal Reports. My first programming language is C# but I also work with all the other .NET Ecosystem languages including Draco and JavaScript (mostly with NodeJS or frontend development, including modern frameworks).
