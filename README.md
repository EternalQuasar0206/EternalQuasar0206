  <h3>ðŸ’œ Welcome, you can call me Vic!</h3>
  <hr>
  
  I'm a software engineer focused in tooling, fullstack development, algorithm challenges and technical documentation. I am a generalist with a strong focus on .NET technologies     based on C# and I use TypeScript/JavaScript as a secondary language.

  I am an open-source content enthusiast and I contribute building tools and libraries for different purposes, usually general and occasionally with specific purposes.
