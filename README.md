Hello, I am Scarlet. 

I am an experienced developer specialized in .NET technologies with relevance on web backend and mobile/desktop/web frontend. Between the stacks that I already have worked on, I can highlight ASP.NET, MAUI (mobile and desktop development), WPF, Windows Forms. In the past I have also worked with Unity, MonoDevelop and other old .NET technologies such as .NET Framework applications and a sort of old libraries like Crystal Reports. My main programming language is C# but I also work with all the other .NET Ecosystem languages including Draco and JavaScript (mostly with NodeJS or frontend development, including modern frameworks).

I also have advanced experience with AWS services and cloud development - including DevOPS best practices and knowledge about SRE and software architecture. I can use other cloud providers such as Google Cloud and Azure with decent proficiency and easily adapt to different development environments and styles. Together with my cloud development experience, I have advanced proficiency in Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift and can perform decently in other orchestration/containerization providers.
